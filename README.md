# Easy-Cpp-Tutorial-for-young-minds

This is my try to teach young minds ranging in age 7 - 13.

I believe C++ is an amazing language and should be the first choice of everyone. Why?

- Very precise, there is no guessing what the parameter is supposed to be, or thinking hard on what the other programmer is wanting to do. In C++ you are so explicit that others can easily read and understand the code.

- Very fast.

- Used in almost everything, except perhaps building websites. C++ is the main language used for building anything serious - Robots, Bitcoin, Operating Systems, IoT devices, Rockets, Medical devices.

- An excellent choice for large projects. If you are building something that you will like to grow, this is the choice.

- Every other language is in some way, shape or form implemented over C or C++.  C++ is essentially C with Object Orientation.

- Most importantly, with C++ you are productive much sooner and much more often.  With most other languages, a developers are constantly pulling their hair out learning new tools, new libraries, new versions. Just catching up seems to be an endless loop. Forget about being productive. C++ allows you to work off a stable, well documented base and spend more time being productive.

- Delivering lasting value. I find that almost any software product that delivers lasting value, lasts the test of time, has actually been written on C++. Let me count a few - Windows, Linux, Git. Products written in other languages are perhaps not thought through well, perhaps not designed well, perhaps are meant as a short term band-aid solution. I am not sure of the precise reason, but they don't seem to be standing the test of time.
