# Easy-Cpp-Tutorial-for-young-minds

This is my try to teach young minds ranging in age 7 - 13.

I believe C++ is an amazing language and should be the first choice of everyone. Why?

- Very precise, there is no guessing what the parameter is supposed to be, or thinking hard on what the other programmer is wanting to do. In C++ you are so explicit that others can easily read and understand the code.

- Very fast. C++ is the fastest option. The fastest is machine code, but we humans can't write that. The second fastest is Assembly language which has very low level instructions like "Move data from Register A to Register B". These are the individual steps that the computer takes for every calculation. And the computer does billions of them every minute, so it's a very difficult task to write Assembly. And quite useless too, as C++ is just a very tiny bit slower than Assembly while providing a 10x or better improvement over productivity of a programmer.

- Used in almost everything, except perhaps building websites. C++ is the main language used for building anything serious - Robots, Bitcoin, Operating Systems, IoT devices, Rockets, Medical devices.

- An excellent choice for large projects. If you are building something that you will like to grow, this is the choice.

- Every other language is in some way, shape or form implemented over C or C++.  C++ is essentially C with Object Orientation.

- Most importantly, with C++ you are productive much sooner and much more often.  With most other languages, a developers are constantly pulling their hair out learning new tools, new libraries, new versions. Just catching up seems to be an endless loop. Forget about being productive. C++ allows you to work off a stable, well documented base and spend more time being productive.

- Delivering lasting value. I find that almost any software product that delivers lasting value, lasts the test of time, has actually been written on C++. Let me count a few - Windows, Linux, Git. Products written in other languages are perhaps not thought through well, perhaps not designed well, perhaps are meant as a short term band-aid solution. I am not sure of the precise reason, but they don't seem to be standing the test of time.
