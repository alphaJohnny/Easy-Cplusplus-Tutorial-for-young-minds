# Easy-Cpp-Tutorial-for-young-minds

This is my try to teach young minds ranging in age 7 - 13.

I believe C++ is an amazing language and should be the first choice of everyone. Why?

- Very precise, there is no guessing what the parameter is supposed to be, or thinking hard on what the other programmer is wanting to do. In C++ you are so explicit that others can easily read and understand the code.

- Very fast.

- Used in almost everything, except perhaps building websites. C++ is the main language used for building anything serious - Robots, Bitcoin, Operating Systems, IoT devices, Rockets, Medical devices.

- An excellent choice for large projects. If you are building something that you will like to grow, this is the choice.

- Every other language is in some way, shape or form implemented over C or C++.  C++ is essentially C with Object Orientation.
