// Compilers compile your code to machine language or byte-code
// This compiled code is in 0s and 1s and computers can run it
// An example will be to compile and run the below program

// My first program in c++
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  std::cout << "My first program in c++";
}

// you can run this program by pressing F5 in most IDEs
// If you press F6, it should move you to debug in most IDEs

// If you prefer compiling and running manually using CLI (commmand line interface)
// Then please use the following commands

// gcc
